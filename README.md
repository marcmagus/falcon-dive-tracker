# Falcon Dive Tracker Package for PopTracker

This is a tracker package for PopTracker or other compatible programs to use with [Final Fantasy IV: Falcon Dive](https://github.com/gameboy9/FF4FalconDive), a randomizer for Final Fantasy IV: Pixel Remaster.

PopTracker can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases).

Alternatively, EmoTracker can be found [here](https://emotracker.net). I am unable to test or debug the pack under EmoTracker, but it might just work.

This package is based on Cyb3RGER's [Template Pack for PopTracker](https://github.com/Cyb3RGER/template_pack/tree/d98851c1ed514a78644e14eabb36d28103c91eb3).

## Installation

Just download the latest build and put in your packs folder (as a zip or unpacked, both work).

### PopTracker

For PopTracker the packs folder can be under `USER/Documents/PopTracker/packs`, `USER/PopTracker/packs` or `APP/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory and `APP` for the PopTracker installation directory.

### EmoTracker

For EmoTracker the packs folder can be found under `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\EmoTracker\packs`.

## Sprites

All sprites either extracted from Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster by me, or custom sprites made using FFIV-PR sprites as a base.

## Autotracking

See [Autotracking.md](Autotracking.md).
